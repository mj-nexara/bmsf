\## 🧭 Purpose



Honorariums are offered to:



\- Recognize the time, risk, and expertise of volunteers  

\- Support field deployment in high-need zones  

\- Encourage trauma-informed, documentation-rich service  

\- Maintain audit-ready records of all disbursements



Honorariums are not salaries and do not constitute formal employment unless specified in a signed contract.
