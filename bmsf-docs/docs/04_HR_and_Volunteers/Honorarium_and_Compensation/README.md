\## 🧭 Compensation Principles



\- \*\*Dignity-Centered\*\*: Every payment reflects the ethical value of service, not just labor  

\- \*\*Donor-Linked\*\*: Disbursements are traceable to specific donor IDs and program tags  

\- \*\*Audit-Ready\*\*: All entries are logged in YAML and spreadsheet formats with timestamped confirmations  

\- \*\*Trauma-Informed\*\*: Gaza deployments include risk allowances and debriefing honorariums

\## 🔐 Compliance \& Review



\- All compensation entries are reviewed by:

&nbsp; - Finance \& Legal Desk  

&nbsp; - HR \& Volunteer Coordination Team  

&nbsp; - External Audit Firm (see `Audit\_Reports/External\_Audit\_2025.pdf`)  

\- Disbursements above ৳15,000 or $200 require dual confirmation and donor linkage

\## 🕊️ Legacy Statement



Compensation is not just a transaction — it is a ritual of recognition. Every honorarium and salary affirms the dignity of those who serve, and preserves their contribution for future guardians.
