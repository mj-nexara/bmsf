\## 🧭 Deployment Principles



\- \*\*Trauma-Informed\*\*: Gaza and emergency deployments include debriefing, risk consent, and honorarium safeguards  

\- \*\*Donor-Linked\*\*: Each deployment is traceable to donor ID and program tag  

\- \*\*Audit-Ready\*\*: All entries are timestamped and referenced in internal/external audit reports  

\- \*\*Multilingual\*\*: Field documentation supports Bengali, English, and Arabic anchors

\## 🔐 Compliance \& Review



\- All deployments are confirmed by:

&nbsp; - HR \& Volunteer Coordination Desk  

&nbsp; - Program Zone Coordinators  

&nbsp; - Finance \& Legal Desk (for donor-funded roles)  

\- Trauma zones require post-deployment debriefing and documentation submission
