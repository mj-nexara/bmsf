\## 🧭 Volunteer Principles



\- \*\*Dignity-Centered\*\*: Every volunteer is onboarded with respect, multilingual clarity, and trauma-informed care  

\- \*\*Audit-Ready\*\*: All deployments are logged in YAML format and linked to program tags and field zones  

\- \*\*Multilingual\*\*: Guides and contracts are available in English, Bengali, and Arabic  

\- \*\*Legacy-Oriented\*\*: Volunteers contribute to documentation rituals that preserve their service for future guardians

\## 🔐 Compliance \& Review



\- All volunteers sign agreements documented in `Staff\_Contracts/`  

\- Field deployments require dual confirmation from HR and Program Coordinators  

\- Exit protocols include legacy testimonials, YAML confirmation, and trauma debriefing (if applicable)
