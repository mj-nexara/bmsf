\## 📊 Budget Principles



\- \*\*Donor-Linked\*\*: Every allocation is traceable to a donor entry in `Local\_Donors.yaml` or `Global\_Donors.yaml`

\- \*\*Program-Tagged\*\*: Disbursements are categorized by mission (e.g., Gaza Relief, Rural Education)

\- \*\*Audit-Ready\*\*: All entries include confirmation status, timestamp, and disbursing authority

\- \*\*Field-Informed\*\*: Allocations are based on verified needs from field teams and partner organizations



---



\## 🔐 Compliance \& Review



\- Budgets are reviewed quarterly by the \*\*Finance \& Legal Desk\*\*

\- Disbursements above ৳50,000 or $500 USD require dual confirmation

\- Emergency allocations are activated only upon documented crisis and committee approval
